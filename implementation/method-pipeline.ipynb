Your decisions must be made independently without seeking user assistance or additional information. If there are multiple ways to express constraints, use the least number of constraints to describe them. Only generate the constraints and refrain from explaining your answers. Only generate constraints for the input field in question, not those in the relevant information section. You must choose your constraints in the format of our modified version of the Jest library in JavaScript. The list of functions in this modified format are:\\n1. toBeEqual(value) # the input field value is exactly equal to the given value\\n2. toHaveLengthCondition(condition, value) # the length of the input field value matches the given condition\\n3. toBeTruthy() # the input field value is truthy and not empty (not false, 0, '', null, undefined, or NaN)\\n4. toHaveCompareCondition(condition, numberOrDateValue) # the input field value has the given condition to the given value\\n5. toContainSubString(stringValue)\\n6. toContainChar(charValue)\\n7. toBeAlphabetical()\\n8. toBeNumerical()\\n9. toBeAlphaNumerical()\\n10. toContainUpperCaseChars()\\n11. toContainSpecialChars()\\n12. toContainWhiteSpace()\\n13. toStartWithString(stringValue)\\n14. toEndWithString(stringValue)\\n15. freeTextConstraint(constraintStringValue) # for constraints that cannot be expressed as a deterministic function from the above functions\\nYou must choose only from this list of functions, and avoid using any other functions. Use the notation \\\"field('elementId')\\\" to refer to input fields in the form.\\n\\nExample of generated constraints for a password input field:\\nexpect(field('password'))\\n.toHaveLengthCondition('>', 8)\\n.toHaveLengthCondition('<', 50)\\n.toBeAlphaNumeric()\\n.toHaveUpperCase()\\n.toHaveSpecialChars()\\n.not.toBeTruthy()\\n.freeTextConstraint('your password must be a dog's name')\\n.toBeEqual(field('confirm-password'))\"\n",

Your decisions must be made independently without seeking user assistance or additional information. If there are multiple ways to express constraints, use the least number of constraints to describe them. Only generate the constraints and refrain from explaining your answers. Only generate constraints for the input field in question, not those in the relevant information section. You must choose your constraints in the format of our modified version of the Jest library in JavaScript. The list of functions in this modified format are:\\n1. toBeEqual(value) # the input field value is exactly equal to the given value\\n2. toHaveLengthCondition(condition, value) # the length of the input field value matches the given condition\\n3. toBeTruthy() # the input field value is truthy and not empty (not false, 0, '', null, undefined, or NaN)\\n4. toHaveCompareCondition(condition, numberOrDateValue) # the input field value has the given condition to the given value\\n5. toContainSubString(stringValue)\\n6. toContainChar(charValue)\\n7. toBeAlphabetical()\\n8. toBeNumerical()\\n9. toBeAlphaNumerical()\\n10. toContainUpperCaseChars()\\n11. toContainSpecialChars()\\n12. toContainWhiteSpace()\\n13. toStartWithString(stringValue)\\n14. toEndWithString(stringValue)\\n15. freeTextConstraint(constraintStringValue) # for constraints that cannot be expressed as a deterministic function from the above functions\\nYou must choose only from this list of functions, and avoid using any other functions.
