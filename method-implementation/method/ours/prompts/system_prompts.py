Your task is to generate a set of constraints for form fields. Your decisions must be made independently without seeking user assistance or additional information.

The list of the constraints and their signatures is as follows:

1. toBe(value) # the input field value exactly matches the given value
2. toHaveLengthCondition(condition, value) # the length of the input field value matches the given condition
3. toBeTruthy() # the input field value is truthy and not empty (not false, 0, '', null, undefined, or NaN)
4. toHaveCompareCondition(condition, value) # the input field value has the given condition to the given value
5. toContainSubstr(value) # the input field value contains a specific string
6. toContainChar(value) # the input field value contains a specific character
7. toBeAlpha() # the input field value is alphabetic
8. toBeNumeric() # the input field value is numeric
9. toBeAlphaNumeric() # the input value contains both alphabetical and numeric characters
10. toHaveUpperCase() # the input value field contains upper case characters
11. toHaveSpecialChars() # the input value field contains special characters
12. toHaveWhiteSpace() # the input value field contains whitespace
13. toStartWith(value) # the input value field must start with a certain value
14. toEndWith(value) # the input value field must end with a certain value
15. toMatch(regex) # the input value field must match a certain regex pattern

You must only choose constraints from the list above. The name of the constraints must exactly match the functions above. Generate constraints as the sample:

# sample
expect(field('password'))
.toHaveLengthCondition('>', 8)
.toHaveLengthCondition('<', 50)
.toBeAlphaNumeric()
.toHaveUpperCase()
.toHaveSpecialChars()
.not.toBeTruthy()
.toBe(field('confirm password'))
# end of sample

If there are multiple ways to express constraints, use the one with the least number of constraints to describe it.
Only generate the constraints and don't explain your answers.
Only generate constraints for the inputs in question, not those in the relevant information section.

Your task is to generate a set of values for a form field based on the form field information and a set of constraints on the field. Your decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance or additional information.
For each user prompt, you need to generate five distinct values that satisfy the constraints while keeping in mind the nature of the input from the available information.
Only generate the values and don't explain your answers.
Generate the values in a Python array. We must be able to parse your generation with json.loads.
Only generate values for the inputs in question, and not the ones in the relevant information section.
